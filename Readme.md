# Knowledge Based QA System with Python and Prolog ![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-yellow) ![prolog](https://img.shields.io/badge/prolog-8.2.0-red)
A knowledge-based system (KBS) is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that aims to capture the knowledge of human experts to support decision-making. Examples of knowledge-based systems include expert systems, which are so called because of their reliance on human expertise.<br>
This project is a simple implementation a knowledge-based system. It is a ChatBot. There a ``prolog`` file that defines the knowledge and questions are handled with ``python``. The key idea is mapping different questions for same answer.

## Installation ![linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/-linux-orange)

> ``$ sudo apt install swi-prolog``<br>
``$ pip3 install pyswip``<br>
``$ pip3 install gTTS``<br>
``$ pip install pygame``<br>
``$ pip3 install SpeechRecognition``<br>
``$ sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio``<br>
``$ pip install pyaudio``<br>
``$ python -m pip install pyttsx3 --user `` <br>

 Install 'PyAudio'. Go to https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ and download wheel file for PyAudio. Then go to download directory and open cmd in that folder. THen type 'python -m pip install (filename.whl) --user'
